([thefoodiediary.com](https://thefoodiediary.com/top-food-brands-committed-to-health-and-wellness/?utm_source=openai))  <br><br>---<br><br>##  Consumer Perceptions: Brands Seen as Healthier<br><br>A pilot consumer survey ranked the perceived healthfulness of various brands, where some of the highest-rated include:<br><br>- **Healthy Choice** and **Kashi®** (both with a rating of 7.4), followed by **Quaker®** (7.3) and **Nature Valley®** (7.2). These brands are regarded more favorably by consumers than big-name processed brands like Kraft or Nabisco. ([pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7431378/?utm_source=openai))<br><br>---<br><br>##  Summary Overview<br><br>Here’s a consolidated list of brands recognized for overall healthfulness:<br><br>• Bob’s Red Mill  <br>• Chobani  <br>• Planters  <br>• Explore Cuisine, San Giorgio, Ronzoni, etc. (high‑nutrition pastas)  <br>• Trader Joe’s, Kirkland Signature, O Organics, 365 Everyday Value (store brands)  <br>• Mary’s Gone Original, Cocomo Coconut Peanut Butter, GoVerden Avocado Cups, Wild Planet Sardines  <br>• Banza, Dr. Praeger’s, Saffron Road (nutritious frozen and grain‑based products)  <br>• Seven Sundays, Ezekiel cereal, Siete Chips, Dave’s Killer Bread  <br>• Vital Farms, Impossible Foods, KIND Snacks (clean‑ingredient, mission‑driven brands)  <br>• Healthy Choice, Kashi, Quaker, Nature Valley (positively perceived by consumers)  <br><br>---<br><br>### Final Thoughts<br><br>- Bulk nutrition metrics favor minimally processed, whole-grain, legume-based, and fortified frozen foods.<br>- Store-brand lines and mission-driven brands often combine ethics with healthier formulations.<br>- Packaged staples like innovative cereals, snack bars, and frozen meals continue improving in nutritional value.<br>- Always cross-reference with new labeling — especially after the FDA’s updated definition of “healthy” (effective February 2028), which will mandate inclusion of fruit/vegetable/whole grain/protein and limits on added sugar, sodium, and saturated fat.
